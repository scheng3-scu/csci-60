// may 9 2025
class::operator =( const class& rhs){
size_ = rhs.size_ // copy the size of the array
delete [] data_ // delete the heap memory




destructor is 
class::~class(){
delete [] data_ // release heap memeory
data_ =nullptr; // make it a empty array
size_ = 0; // change the array size to 0
}

when you call this = for a chain you will have a this ptr that is automacally made so you can return *this

GArray& GArray::operator:: =



// template prefiix (need to be included in both delcaration and incartion)
template <typename T>
void swapValue(T& car1, T&var2)'
